Usage:
- Would be nice to display the quantity for option 1 (Display Vending Machine Items)

- Your out of stock message was funny :D , but I would prefer a
more professional sounding message like - "Out of Stock"

Code:
- You have a lot of unused variables, unused methods and commented out code.

- Even though your code works, you should consider creating a hierarchy of
products with an abstract products class and concrete sub-classes for gum,
drink, chips, and candy.

- From a design standpoint, consider separating your "presentation" code (like System outs)
with the code that performs actual work and calculations. For instance, one way
to do this would be to refactor the method pumpChange() so that it returns a String
containing the change message instead of having the method void. pumpChange() would then
be called by the CLI and its result stored into a String and printed out.
